How to start & contribute to this project? document or resouce about project structure, naming convensions, etc?
- is there any reason to use variables with back ticks (like a variable declaration with a reserved key) in Dependencies.scala file?
- looks like it's not integrated with scala-steward, but I saw scala-steward.conf file.
- Would be nice to see the scala version in build.sbt.
- Would be nice to have org name in the package structure, like `it.forelead.babymed.xxx`
